<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #666; text-align: justify;">The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) is a pivotal evolution in next-generation communication systems (6G) {% cite a9779322 %}. This convergence aims to provide ubiquitous, reliable, and resilient connectivity by leveraging the strengths of both ground-based infrastructure and space-borne assets like satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By seamlessly unifying these diverse network layers, we can extend coverage to remote and underserved areas, ensure service continuity during natural disasters, and support high-mobility applications where terrestrial coverage is intermittent or unavailable. This holistic approach is essential for realizing the vision of global connectivity and enabling transformative applications in intelligent transportation, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.</p>
