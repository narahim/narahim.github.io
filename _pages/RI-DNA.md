<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #666; text-align: justify;">With the ever-increasing information in the digital world, the effective way to store enormous data with high reliability, capacity and durability has been much discussed. In recent years, owing to the superior properties like extremely high physical density and preservation duration, using DNA molecules as the data storage medium has drawn a rising attention. However, the unique biochemical processes involved in DNA storage introduce specific types of errors that differ from traditional storage media. Understanding and modeling these data-dependent and process-dependent errors is crucial for designing robust coding schemes and ensuring reliable data retrieval {% cite a10005802 %}.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #666;">Within the scope of DNA-based data storage, I am actively engaged in the following areas:</p>
