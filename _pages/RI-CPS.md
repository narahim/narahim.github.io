<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #666; text-align: justify;">Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer broadly to the next generation of engineered systems that require efficient integration of computing, communication, and control technologies achieving stability, robustness, reliability and optimized performance in many important application domains, such as industrial automation, advanced healthcare, and smart power grids. A critical enabler for these systems is <strong>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</strong>, which ensures deterministic and low-latency communication essential for real-time control loops {% cite COMST %}. Furthermore, the concept of the <strong>Digital Twin</strong>—a virtual representation of a physical system—is revolutionizing CPS by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive maintenance, thereby enhancing the adaptability and resilience of physical operations. Additionally, ensuring <strong>cybersecurity</strong> is paramount, particularly in critical infrastructure like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, to protect against evolving threats and ensure system integrity {% cite RAZZAQUE2025126364 %}.</p>
