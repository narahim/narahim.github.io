@article{Noor-A-Rahim2022,
abstract = {Long-range (LoRa) communication has attracted much attention recently due to its utility for many Internet of Things applications. However, one of the key problems of LoRa technology is that it is vulnerable to noise/interference due to the use of only up-chirp signals during modulation. In this paper, to solve this problem, unlike the conventional LoRa modulation scheme, we propose a modulation scheme for LoRa communication based on joint up- and down-chirps. A fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based demodulation scheme is devised to detect modulated symbols. To further improve the demodulation performance, a hybrid demodulation scheme, comprised of FFT- and correlation-based demodulation, is also proposed. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulation results. Compared to the conventional LoRa modulation scheme, we show that the proposed scheme exhibits over 3 dB performance gain at a bit error rate of 10−4.},

@article{Sedghi2022,
abstract = {This paper presents the formation tracking problem for non-holonomic automated guided vehicles. Specifically, we focus on a decentralized leader–follower approach using linear quadratic regulator control. We study the impact of communication packet loss—containing the position of the leader—on the performance of the presented formation control scheme. The simulation results indicate that packet loss degrades the formation control performance. In order to improve the control performance under packet loss, we propose the use of a long short-term memory neural network to predict the position of the leader by the followers in the event of packet loss. The proposed scheme is compared with two other prediction methods, namely, memory consensus protocol and gated recurrent unit. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the long short-term memory in packet loss compensation in comparison with memory consensus protocol and gated recurrent unit.},
