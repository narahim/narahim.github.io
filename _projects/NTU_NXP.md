<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, the NTU-NXP Smart Mobility Test Bed was established to test and develop new technologies for vehicles to communicate with each other and with designated roadside infrastructures. Known as V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) technology, this initiative aimed to push new frontiers in mobility.    </p>
    
    <p>Constructed using cutting-edge technology from NTU and NXP, the test bed enabled companies, research institutes, and government agencies to deploy, test, and validate future V2X solutions in a real-world scenario. With a total investment of S$22 million, this campus-wide test bed facilitated the exploration of V2X applications, which involved wireless communications between vehicles and intelligent infrastructure such as traffic cameras and traffic lights.    </p>
