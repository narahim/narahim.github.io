    <p>This project aims to harness the untapped potential of the mmWave and THz frequency spectrum to achieve the ambitious Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of 6G technology, such as terabits per second data rates, connectivity for billions of devices, and sub-millisecond access latency. By exploiting the abundant frequency resources available in the mmWave and THz bands, which offer larger bandwidth compared to sub-6 GHz frequencies, congested in existing cellular systems, we aim to enable high-speed data transmission and ultra-low latency for 6G-V2X communications {% cite a9779322 %}. Despite extensive research on infrastructure-based 5G mmWave communications, challenges persist in V2X communications at mmWave and THz frequencies, including propagation loss and susceptibility to blockage by obstacles {% cite a9186820 %}. Moreover, the deployment of much smaller cells in these frequency bands may lead to increased handover frequencies, posing further challenges for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for advanced V2X applications. Therefore, this project seeks to explore innovative solutions, including multi-radio access technologies combining sub-6 GHz, mmWave, and THz frequencies, to overcome these challenges and pave the way for future 6G-V2X networks. </p>
