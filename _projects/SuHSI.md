    <p>To accelerate the decarbonisation of integrated energy systems activities at the national and global levels, conventional homes are being turned into super homes by introducing distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar PV, Energy Storage, Heat Pump, Electric Vehicle etc. SuHSI’s aim is to develop a smart inverter for super homes that can seamlessly include DERs and is also compatible with Irish Low Voltage Distribution Network (LVDN). Additionally, they will design an efficient home energy management system that will ultimately lower energy expenses for consumers. The new solutions will enhance the activities of empowering energy citizens and expedite the adoption of DERs to reduce carbon emissions in the distribution network.</p>
